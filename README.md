# Intrusion-Detection-in-IoT-Networks-using-Deep-Learning

I have created an algorithm for identifying denial-of-service (DoS) threats using Deep Learning.

DDos_TCP is the dataset used in this experiment. The dataset has exceeded its size limit that's why it is not uploaded here. but it can be provided via the drive link on request.

In this experiment, I examined the performance of the ANN algorithm in an IoT network. ANN algorithm has given good results in terms of AUC and accuracy for binary classification.
